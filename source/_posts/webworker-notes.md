WebWorker has now been supported by majority of browsers ([link](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers)). I have started to use WebWorkers seriously in my projects (web pages / web apps / cordova mobile apps).

Below reference pages were used while doing my study:

* [Using webworkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)
* [webworker and phonegap](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28642547/phonegap-and-webworkers)
